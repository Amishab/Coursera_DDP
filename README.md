The [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application on calulation of EMI for loan amount of $10,000 for 30 year fixed period based on APR input form user is at https://amishab.shinyapps.io/EMIShinyApp/

I created data in EMIData.csv for APR ranging from 3.5% to 10% based on following formula

EMI is calculated like...

E = P * r * (((1+r)^n) / (((1+r)^n) -1))

Where 
E = EMI
P = principal
r = interest rate per month
n = number of months
